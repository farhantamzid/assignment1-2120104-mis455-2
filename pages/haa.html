          >In March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, Human After All,
          the result of six weeks of writing and recording. Reviews were mixed,
          with criticism for its repetitiveness and darker mood. "Robot Rock",
          "Technologic", "Human After All" and "The Prime Time of Your Life"
          were released as singles. A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD, Musique Vol. 1
          1993â€“2005, was released on 4 April 2006. Daft Punk also released a
          remix album, Human After All: Remixes.</b

          >For 48 dates across 2006 and 2007, Daft Punk performed the Alive
          2006/2007 world tour, performing a "megamix" of their music from a
          large LED-fronted pyramid. The tour was acclaimed and is credited for
          bringing dance music to a wider audience, especially in North America.
          The Guardian journalist Gabriel Szatan likened it to how the Beatles'
          1964 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show had brought British rock and
          roll to the American mainstream.</b
