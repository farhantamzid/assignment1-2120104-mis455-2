            >Daft Punk released their debut album, Homework, in 1997. That
            February, the UK dance magazine Muzik published a Daft Punk cover
            feature and described Homework as "one of the most hyped debut
            albums in a long long time". According to The Village Voice, the
            album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula.
            The critic Alex Rayner wrote that it combined established club
            styles and the "burgeoning eclecticism" of big beat. In 1997, Daft
            Punk embarked on an international concert tour, Daftendirektour,
            using their home equipment for the live stage. On 25 May, they
            headlined the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, with
            Orbital and Kraftwerk.

            and Crydamoure, after the release of Homework, and released solo
            projects by themselves and their friends. Homem-Christo released
            music as a member of Le Knight Club with Eric Chedeville, and
            Bangalter released music as a member of Together with DJ Falcon and
            founded the group Stardust with Alan Braxe and Benjamin Diamond. In
            1998, Stardust released their only song, the chart hit "Music Sounds
            Better With You". <br />
