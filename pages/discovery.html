          >Daft Punk's second album, Discovery, was released in 2001. The duo
          said it was an attempt to reconnect with the playful, open-minded
          attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. The album
          reached No. 2 in the UK, and its lead single, "One More Time", was a
          hit. The song is heavily autotuned and compressed. The singles
          "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" were also
          successful in the UK and on the US Dance Chart, and "Face to Face" hit
          number one on the US club play charts. <br />

          >Discovery created a new generation of Daft Punk fans. It also saw
          Daft Punk debut their distinctive robot costumes; they had previously
          worn Halloween masks or bags for promotional appearances. Discovery
          was later named one of the best albums of the decade by publications
          including Pitchfork and Resident Advisor. In 2020, Rolling Stone
          included it at number 236 in its list of the "500 Greatest Albums of
          All Time". In 2021, Pitchfork cited Discovery as the centrepiece of
          Daft Punk's career, "an album that transcended the robots' club roots
          and rippled through the decades that followed". <br />
