          >Random Access Memories was released on 17 May 2013. The lead single,
          "Get Lucky", became Daft Punk's first UK number-one single and the
          most-streamed new song in the history of Spotify. At the 2013 MTV
          Video Music Awards, Daft Punk debuted a trailer for their single "Lose
          Yourself to Dance" and presented the award for "Best Female Video"
          alongside Rodgers and Pharrell. In December, they revealed a music
          video for the song "Instant Crush", directed by Warren Fu and
          featuring Julian Casablancas. <br />
